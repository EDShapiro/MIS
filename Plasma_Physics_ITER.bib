	abstract = {Flux-driven global gyrokinetic codes are now mature enough to make predictions in terms of turbulence and transport in tokamak plasmas. Some of the recent breakthroughs of three such codes, namely {GYSELA}, {ORB}5 and {XGC}1, are reported and compared wherever appropriate. In all three codes, turbulent transport appears to be mediated by avalanche-like events, for a broad range of ρ * = ρ i / a values, ratio of the gyro-radius over the minor radius. Still, the radial correlation length scales with ρ i , leading to the gyro-Bohm scaling of the effective transport coefficient below ρ * ≈ 1/300. The possible explanation could be due to the fact that avalanches remain meso-scale due to the interaction with zonal flows, whose characteristic radial wavelength appears to be almost independent of the system size. As a result of the radial corrugation of the turbulence driven zonal and mean flows, the shear of the radial electric field can be significantly underestimated if poloidal rotation is assumed to be governed by the neoclassical theory, especially at low collisionality. Indeed, the turbulence contribution to the poloidal rotation increases when collisionality decreases. Finally, the numerical verification of toroidal momentum balance shows that both neoclassical and turbulent contributions to the Reynolds' stress tensor play the dominant role. The phase space analysis further reveals that barely passing supra-thermal particles mostly contribute to the toroidal flow generation, consistently with quasi-linear predictions.},

The laser blow-off technique was combined with soft x-ray measurements of a single charge state of calcium to provide time-evolving proﬁles of this non-intrinsic, non-recycling impurity over a radial range of 0.0 r/a 0.6. Experimental transport coefﬁcient proﬁles and their uncertainties were extracted from the measurements using the impurity transport code {STRAHL} and rigorous Monte Carlo error analysis. To best assess the agreement of gyrokinetic simulations with the experimental proﬁles, the sensitivity of the {GYRO} predicted impurity transport to a wide range of turbulence-relevant plasma parameters was investigated. A direct comparison of nonlinear gyrokinetic simulation and experiment is presented with an in depth discussion of error sources and a new data analysis methodology.},

	abstract = {If the equations that describe the observed anomalous transport in magnetic confinement systems are invariant under a scale transformation then any confinement time calculated from them must exhibit the same invariance, no matter how intractable the calculation. This principle places constraints on the form of the confinement time scaling which are characteristic of the plasma model represented by the equations. These constraints reduce the number of parameters which have to be investigated empirically and can serve to indicate which plasma models could describe the observed losses. By extending this argument to specific models of turbulent transport in which the magnetic configuration and the physical mechanism for transport are identified, one can closely define the form of local transport coefficients-in certain cases completely determining them. This paper provides a review of these ideas, shows how they provide a theoretical framework for discussing existing empirical confinement scalings and illustrates their use in classifying and determining the form of local transport coefficients.},
